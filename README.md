# Objectnimator
You realized that you want to create, for example, an Object show, but the programs you want to use to animate are premium, or is the free version very limited?, Well, here there is Objectnimator, a free and open source app to animate your object shows, YOU can help and give ideas, so if there is a problem, even YOU can fix those problems with coding.

>[!NOTE] 
> We recommend that you learn/know how to program in HTML, CSS, and JS, including Node JS, to develop. This is not focused on users who use it for animation, but rather on those who fix bugs or develop improvements for the app.
